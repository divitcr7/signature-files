      <p>
        This Employee Handbook supersedes prior versions and may be updated at Benchmark’s discretion.
        Employees are responsible for staying current on revisions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>About Benchmark Insurance Group</h2>
      <p>
        Benchmark Insurance Group is a privately held insurance brokerage specializing in real estate, construction,
        and hospitality risks with its inception in 2007. Benchmark delivers tailored insurance solutions, proactive
        risk management strategies, and hands-on client service nationwide. Benchmark combines industry expertise,
        proprietary technology, and disciplined processes to provide transparency, competitive coverage placement,
        and long-term client partnerships.
      </p>

      <h3>Vision, Mission &amp; Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vision:</strong> To empower clients with insurance solutions that address real-world risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Mission:</strong> To help clients navigate uncertainty with confidence through accessible, accurate, and timely expertise.</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Employment Relationship &amp; At-Will Status</h2>
      <p>
        All employment with Benchmark is at-will. This means that either the employee or Benchmark may terminate the
        employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice, subject to applicable law. Nothing in
        this handbook, or any other company communication, creates a contract of employment or guarantees employment
        for any specific duration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benchmark reserves the right to modify job duties, compensation, schedules, work locations, and policies at its
        discretion. Only a written agreement signed by the President of Benchmark can alter the at-will nature of employment.
      </p>

      <h3>Introductory Period</h3>
      <p>
        All new employees are subject to a 90-day introductory period beginning on the first day of employment. This period
        allows both the employee and the company to evaluate performance, productivity, professionalism, and cultural alignment.
        Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment or alter at-will status.
      </p>

      <h3>Separation of Employment</h3>
      <p>
        Employees are requested to provide at least two weeks’ notice for voluntary resignation. Benchmark may conduct exit
        interviews to support continuous improvement. Company property must be returned upon separation. Final pay and benefits
        are processed in accordance with policy and law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Ownership Culture &amp; Service Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        Benchmark fosters an ownership culture in which employees are expected to think like business owners. This includes
        taking accountability for results, managing time effectively, exercising sound judgment, and proactively addressing
        client needs. Every employee plays a role in delivering Benchmark’s value proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Employees are expected to communicate clearly, respond promptly, maintain accurate documentation,
        and uphold the highest professional and ethical standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Workplace Conduct &amp; Professional Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Benchmark maintains a professional, substance-free workplace. Employees must conduct themselves ethically,
        comply with company policies, and treat colleagues, clients, and partners with respect.
        Business casual attire is expected unless otherwise directed. Professional appearance is required for client
        meetings and virtual engagements.
      </p>
    </section>

        sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or
        any other protected characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harassment of any kind—including verbal, physical, visual, or electronic—is strictly prohibited. Employees are encouraged
        to report concerns promptly without fear of retaliation.

      <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>

        Positions may be designated as in-office, hybrid, or remote. Employees must maintain a secure, professional,
        and distraction-free work environment regardless of location.

      <h3>Employment Classification</h3>
      <p>
        Benchmark employees may be classified as management, Producers, Account Managers, or administrative support staff.
        Positions involving the solicitation, sale, or servicing of insurance require appropriate licenses issued by the
        Texas Department of Insurance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Licensing</h2>
      <p>
        All employees whose roles involve the solicitation, sale, or servicing of insurance products must hold and maintain
        valid and active insurance licenses as required by the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). These licenses must be
        appropriate to the lines of authority and responsibilities assigned to the individual’s role (e.g., Property &amp; Casualty).
        Maintaining active licensure, completing continuing education, and reporting licensing issues are conditions of employment.
      </p>

      <h3>Licensing Compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Employment:</strong> Offers of employment for licensed positions are contingent upon the candidate possessing the required license(s) or obtaining them within a specified time frame outlined during the hiring process.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing Employment:</strong> Continued employment is conditional upon maintaining current, active licenses. This includes fulfilling all continuing education (CE) requirements and submitting timely license renewals in accordance with TDI regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting Requirements:</strong> Employees must immediately inform management of any changes to their licensing status, including suspensions, expirations, change of address or disciplinary actions taken by the TDI.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to Maintain Licensure:</strong> Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary licensure may result in reassignment, suspension, or termination of employment, depending on the nature of the role and applicable legal and regulatory standards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Background Checks</h3>
      <p>
        For applicants applying for positions that require a valid insurance license in the state of Texas, background checks may include
        but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Criminal history (state and federal)</li>
        <li>Credit report, as permitted by law</li>
        <li>Professional license verification, including status and any past disciplinary actions</li>
        <li>Employment history</li>
        <li>Education verification</li>
        <li>Regulatory compliance history (e.g. TDI, NAIC reports)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conditional Employment</h3>
      <p>
        All offers of employment for licensed roles are contingent upon the successful completion of the background check.
        Any misrepresentation, omission, or failure to pass the background screening may result in withdrawal of an offer or
        immediate termination of employment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Payroll &amp; Compensation</h2>
      <p>
        Employees are paid via direct deposit on the 1st and 15th of each month, subject to banking holidays. Employees are
        responsible for maintaining accurate payroll and tax information.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Paid Time Off (PTO) policy is designed to provide employees with time for rest, personal needs, and family responsibilities
        while balancing the company’s operational needs. Time off necessary to fulfill jury duty obligations is also considered time off
        with pay (PTO).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our company encourages regular PTO while preserving options for exceptional circumstances that may arise. Our policy allows a portion
        of unused PTO to roll over into the following year, ensuring flexibility for employees while maintaining productivity and predictability
        for the company.
      </p>

      <h3>Accrual of PTO</h3>
      <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> PTO is available to all full-time employees upon completion of 90 days of employment.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Accrual Rate:</strong> Employees accrue PTO based on their length of service; after the first 2 years the employee accrues
        1.5 days of PTO in addition to the previous year of employment till the 6th year as shown below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>0 to 2 Years of Service: 14 days annually (1.16 day monthly)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 Years of Service: 15.5 days annually (1.29 day monthly)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 Years of Service: 17 days annually (1.41 day monthly)</li>
        <li>4 to 5 Years of Service: 18.5 days annually (1.54 day monthly)</li>
        <li>5+ Years of Service: 20 days annually (1.66 day monthly)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Note: PTO is accrued proportionally during each pay period.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h3>Rollover of Unused PTO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rollover Limit:</strong> Employees may roll over up to 5 days or 40 hours of unused PTO into the next calendar year.</li>
        <li><strong>Rollover Deadline:</strong> Rolled-over PTO must be used by June 30th of the following year, after which any remaining unused days will be forfeited.</li>
        <li><strong>Rollover Restriction:</strong> Rollover PTO cannot exceed the annual rollover limit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Maximum PTO Balance</h3>
      <p>
        Employees may not accrue a PTO balance exceeding 1.5 times their annual accrual limit. Once this cap is reached,
        additional PTO will stop accruing until some PTO is used.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling and Use of PTO</h3>
      <p>
        Employees are encouraged to request PTO at least 2 weeks in advance for planned absences. PTO requests are subject
        to approval by management based on business needs and staffing requirements. In cases of unplanned absences, employees
        must notify their supervisor as soon as possible and update their PTO account accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>PTO Payout Upon Separation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voluntary Separation:</strong> Employees who voluntarily leave the company will be paid for unused PTO accrued during the current year, up to a maximum of 10 days or 80 hours, unless otherwise required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Involuntary Separation:</strong> Employees terminated for cause will not receive payout for unused PTO, except where required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exclusions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>PTO does not accrue during unpaid leaves of absence or while on long-term disability.</li>
        <li>Rolled-over PTO cannot be cashed out and must be used within the rollover deadline.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Insurance Carrier Representation</h2>
      <p>
        No business is to be placed with an insurer with less than an "A-" A.M. Best Rating. Requests for exceptions for an individual policy
        must be in writing and approved by the Agency President. These requests should indicate the type of policy, markets approached, and
        other circumstances that affect placement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should an exception be granted, the insured would be asked to sign a statement acknowledging they have been advised of the A.M. Best rating.
      </p>

      <h3>Insurance Carrier and Broker Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        The authority to sign insurance company contracts, brokerage contracts or vendor agreements resides with the agency president or V.P. Operations.
      </p>

      <h3>Capital Expenditures</h3>
      <p>
        Capital expenditures will be planned for in the annual budget process. These expenditures are reviewed and approved by the agency president.
        No employee – except the agency president has the authority to bind Benchmark on any service or contract.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Errors and Omissions / Customer Complaints</h2>
      <p>
        Benchmark understands the importance and value of our brand. We also understand that from time to time we will have clients that are unhappy
        with our product or services. The agency will track complaints and potential errors and omissions through an incident log.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incidents will be tracked and communicated to the agency's president as a standing agenda item. In addition, these items will be shared with
        appropriate Benchmark team members on a need-to-know basis.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Agency Expense Reimbursement</h2>
      <p>
        Benchmark understands that its greatest asset is its employees. We will provide up to $500 on an annual basis to enhance professional development.
        This must have prior approval from your manager or agency ownership.
      </p>

      <h2>Education Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Benchmark’s strength lies in our people – the ability to assist clients in constructing their protection programs. The agency supports the
        development of our employees in terms of the technical and operational aspects of the agency. In addition, regulators require continuing
        education credits to maintain compliance for the licensed employee.
      </p>
      <p>
        A personal development program will be a portion of the employee’s annual review process. The development program will be reviewed/approved
        by the employee’s direct manager and the agency president.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
